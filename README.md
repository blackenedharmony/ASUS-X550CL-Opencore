# UPDATE: This is no longer maintained!
As you can tell, I haven't updated this EFI in a while. That's because I sold my ASUS X550CL last year. 

# ASUS-X550CL-Opencore
Full EFI folder without the recovery images to get MacOS Monterey working on the ASUS X550CL/552C.

## Broken
- Wi-Fi
- As far as i can tell, hardware acceleration is not working.

## Working
Most things, test it out and see for yourself.

This is still an experimental EFI folder, and I would really appreciate feedback since I want to keep this updated for a while, since I want this laptop's community to survive for a bit longer.
